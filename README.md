# CryptoNite
CryptoNite
CryptoNite is a web-based portal for crypto enthusiasts that I developed using MySQL, Node.js, Next.js, Express.js, and HTML. In this project, I worked on both the front-end and back-end to provide a seamless user experience.

Features:-
Live crypto feed of more than 20 currencies.
Apex Charts for data visualization and improved user interface.
Scalable and robust backend created using Express.js.
